    Fix disconnected thruster joints (#12 <https://github.com/heron/heron/issues/12>)
    * Use a fixed joint for the thrusters unless we're in simulation; these joints are purely decorative outside gazebo, and the tf is not published except in simulation anyway
    * Remove superfluous .py; they were a copy & paste error
