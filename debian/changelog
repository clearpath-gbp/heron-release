ros-kinetic-heron-description (0.3.4-1xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Fix disconnected thruster joints (#12 <https://github.com/heron/heron/issues/12>)
    * Use a fixed joint for the thrusters unless we're in simulation; these joints are purely decorative outside gazebo, and the tf is not published except in simulation anyway
    * Remove superfluous .py; they were a copy & paste error
  * Merge pull request #11 <https://github.com/heron/heron/issues/11> from heron/no-um6
    Rename UM6 env vars to be generic IMU
  * Rename the UM6 IMU env vars to remove the reference to UM6; make them generic IMU vars instead
  * [heron_description] Dropped --in-order arg from xacro since it is default in Melodic.
  * [heron_description] Added xacro xml namespace prefix.
  * [heron_description] Dropped .py on xacro since it is deprecated.

ros-kinetic-heron-description (0.3.3-1xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Update ROS deps to remove/rename third-party packages that are not available on Melodic
  * Related to https://github.com/heron/heron_simulator/pull/6.  Change the topic that the mag data is published to so we can translate it to the new message standard to work-around a bug with the imu filter.
